## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-03

First stable release. Core email pipeline, AI classification, and dashboard are fully operational.

### Added
- IMAP email ingestion with polling loop (`email-worker`)
- Microsoft Graph / Outlook ingestion (`api-worker`)
- RFC822 email parsing with multipart and attachment support
- Hybrid AI classifier: rule-based (fast) + LLM (Qwen 2.5 via OpenAI-compatible API)
- Redis job queue — LPUSH enqueue / BRPOP blocking consumption
- AI worker that classifies emails and moves them to labelled IMAP folders
- PostgreSQL persistence with SQLAlchemy 2.0 async ORM
- ROI telemetry: prompt tokens, completion tokens, processing time per email
- Fernet encryption for credentials stored in the database (`MASTER_KEY`)
- Streamlit dashboard with login, KPI metrics, classification charts, audit table
- Email Accounts management UI: add/toggle/delete IMAP and Outlook accounts
- Docker Compose for local development and production (Traefik + HTTPS)
- GitHub Actions CI → Portainer webhook auto-deploy

### Fixed
- `imap_worker.py` `mark_seen`: missing closing `)` in IMAP `\Seen` flag
- `hybrid_classifier.py`: missing `ClassificationResult` import causing runtime crash
- `crypto.py`: encryption was disabled — plaintext credentials stored in DB
- `api_worker.py` / `seed_outlook_credentials.py`: hardcoded `"master-key-disabled"` replaced with `settings.master_key`
- `Makefile`: stale Yii2/PHP container references replaced with correct service names
